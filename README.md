## tide-analysis
<i>This Repository contains all the code pertaining to various aspects of tide data analysis 
Tide Data Analysis pertains to everything that is received from Tide Gauge Network that has been operational and sends data to the INCOIS sea level data server,  The data needs to be analysed for monthly, daily and yearly analysis both spectral analysis and time-frequency analysis and harmonic analysis of the tide gauge data. The data analysis python code is written in this repository.</i>

<i> The Tide data can be analysed in multiple ways, Frequency Analysis, Spectral Analysis, Harmonic Analysis and Stastical Analysis.  Throughout this process, various scientific techniques need to be used which have been coded using multiple open source packages available in the python stand library and python packages. </i>
